# MyPeriodTrackerApp

A privacy-first period and health tracking app for mobile devices, built with React Native and Expo. It contains no ads, doesn't ask for an account, and only stores your data locally. Made with love by a female software engineer vibe-coding a period tracking app for herself. 

## Key Features

- **Period Tracking:** Log period days with one tap. First day of each period auto-fills a typical 5-day cycle (customizable).
- **Fertility & Ovulation Prediction:** See predicted fertile windows and ovulation days based on your logged cycles.
- **Symptom Logging:** Track common and custom symptoms each day. Add or remove symptoms to personalize your checklist.
- **Weight Tracking:** Log your weight daily, view trends in a chart, and switch between lbs/kg units.
- **Calendar View:** Visual month view with color-coded days for period, fertile window, ovulation, and a highlight for today.
- **Activity Log:** See a timeline of your recent period, symptoms, and weight entries.
- **Data Persistence:** All your data is stored locally on your device in a private, persistent file (no cloud or account required).
- **Privacy:** No data ever leaves your device. No ads, no tracking, no accounts.
- **Free & Open Source:** This app is free to use, open-source, and licensed under the MIT License.
