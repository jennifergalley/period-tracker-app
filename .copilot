Always use TypeScript for new files.
Prefer functional React components.
Use async/await for asynchronous code.
Always create helper methods in files in the features directory according to their function, e.g. put things related to cycles in cycleUtils.ts or date functions in the dateUtils.ts.
Always create handler methods in Handlers.ts and re-use them first from there, so that we follow DRY principles.
I want to be able to read and understand the code, so make sure you write well-documented code, with explainer comments and good documentation. Never delete comments that are already there unless they are todos you are checking off or pertain to code you are deleting.
